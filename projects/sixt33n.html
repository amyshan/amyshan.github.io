                <p style="font-size: small">
                    In Fall 2016, I took the second part of Designing Information Devices and Systems, our two-part
                    foundation series for electrical engineering. Our final project was to apply the design concepts
                    we learned in the course to build a voice-controlled car, called the
                    <a href="https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ee16b/sp16/proj/">Sixt33n Car</a>.
                </p>
                <h6 style="font-weight: bold">Circuit Design</h6>
                <p style="font-size: small">
                    The first stage of our design was the front-end of the circuit, in which we took in the signal from
                    the microphone and filtered it to the proper frequency and voltage for the MSP to process. From
                    the output of the mic board we used a low-pass filter -> buffer -> low-pass filter -> buffer ->
                    amplifier -> op-amp that caps off within range of the MSP’s tolerance.
                </p>
                <p style="font-size: small">
                    The next stage was the battery and voltage regulator. We ran the car off two 9V batteries, one of
                    which powered the motors and the other which powered the voltage regulator, MSP, front-end
                    circuit, and wheel encoders. The voltage regulator, which takes in the 9V input from the battery,
                    lowers it to 5V before passing that value into the 5V rail that powers the front-end circuit and
                    MSP.
                </p>
                <p style="font-size: small">
                    The second battery powered the motors. For each motor, an NPM BJT
                    used the current from the MSP to control the switch that let power flow to the motor, which was
                    connected to our circuit through a diode. The diode served to protest the BJT, which is prevented
                    from burnout with a 2kΩ resistor to soften the current. Lastly we connected wheel encoders to the
                    MSP in order to collect data for our control schema.

                <p style="font-size: small">
                    Since our car was voice-controlled, we had to program words as commands for the car to recognize and
                    execute appropriately. We chose:
                </p>
                    <ul style="font-size: small">
                        <li>“Amy” – slow straight</li>
                        <li>“Wao” – fast straight</li>
                        <li>“PCA” – turn right</li>
                        <li>“Marique” – turn left</li>
                    </ul>
                <p style="font-size: small">
                    We initially used words we thought would be more fitting for each command, or words that were funny,
                    but we realized those wouldn’t work soon after we ran our PCA classification algorithm on our samples
                    and had nearly identical graphs and an overall random pattern in the clustering. We then decided to
                    opt for words with distinct syllables of varying length and tried to record voice samples with as
                    little variance in intonation and background noise as possible, which significantly improved
                    our clustering. We also recorded a large collection of various words (~10) and swapped them out in
                    different combinations to arrive at a 90%+ accuracy in classification.
